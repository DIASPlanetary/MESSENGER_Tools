	Description : 
            Time-averaged spacecraft position and calibrated 3-axis magnetic field samples in Mercury 
            Solar Orbital (MSO) coordinates. The data are tagged with latency corrected UTC and MET 
            time stamps at the center of each interval. The MSO RDR is derived from the Science CDR for 
            this coordinate system with time averages computed within 1, 5, 10, and 60 s intervals.
